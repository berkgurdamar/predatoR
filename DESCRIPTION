Description: Mutation impact prediction has an important role in understanding the
            roles of mutations in diseases. predatoR package makes prediction about
            amino acid substitutions on protein structures. With using PDB ID, chain ID, residue, 
            reference amino acid, mutated amino acid and gene name (optional), 
            calculates the impact of a mutation  and classifies the mutations
            as pathogenic or neutral.
